    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of 
        <strong>TakeGo</strong>, a token-based takeaway order management system 
        developed as part of an academic Software Engineering project.
        By accessing or using this platform, you agree to comply with these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of the Platform</h2>
    <p>
        TakeGo is developed strictly for academic, demonstration, and evaluation purposes.
        It is not a commercial product and is not intended for real-world business operations.
        No real financial transactions are processed through this system.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>The platform supports two primary roles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Customers:</strong> Users who register, browse stalls,
            generate order tokens, and track order status.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stall Owners:</strong> Users who manage products,
            update availability, accept/reject orders, and mark orders as ready.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Users are responsible for using their assigned role appropriately.
        Unauthorized access or misuse of role-based functionality is prohibited.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users must register before accessing system features.</li>
        <li>Usernames must follow platform validation rules.</li>
        <li>Passwords are stored using hashing techniques for security demonstration.</li>
        <li>Users are advised not to use real-world sensitive credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        While security mechanisms are implemented for educational purposes,
        this system should not be treated as a production-grade secure application.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Token-Based Order System</h2>
    <p>
        When a customer places an order, the system generates a unique token number.
        Tokens are generated sequentially per stall to simulate queue management logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        The token mechanism is intended to demonstrate:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Database transactions</li>
        <li>Concurrent order handling logic</li>
        <li>Queue simulation per stall</li>
        <li>Status updates (Pending, Accepted, Ready, Rejected, Cancelled)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Orders and Availability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orders can only be placed if product availability is sufficient.</li>
        <li>Availability is automatically reduced upon successful order placement.</li>
        <li>Stall owners may update product availability at any time.</li>
        <li>Order records may be soft-deleted for system demonstration purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Order preparation time displayed is calculated based on product prep-time logic
        and is intended only for simulation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>
        TakeGo does not integrate any real payment gateway.
        All pricing displayed is for academic demonstration only.
        No real financial processing occurs within this platform.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Handling and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The system uses a SQLite database for demonstration of relational data management.
        Data stored may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>User role</li>
        <li>Product information</li>
        <li>Order records</li>
        <li>Generated tokens</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Data may be reset, modified, or cleared at any time during development,
        testing, or academic evaluation.
    </p>

    <h2>8. System Availability</h2>
    <p>
        As this is an academic project, uptime and availability are not guaranteed.
        The system may be temporarily unavailable during development, debugging,
        deployment, or testing phases.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The developers of TakeGo are not liable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data loss</li>
        <li>System interruptions</li>
        <li>Incorrect token generation during testing</li>
        <li>Misuse of the platform</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Use of this platform is entirely at the user's discretion for academic demonstration purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Modifications to the System</h2>
    <p>
        The system architecture, database structure, or features may be modified
        at any time as part of development or academic evaluation requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Termination of Access</h2>
    <p>
        Access to the platform may be restricted or terminated if misuse,
        role abuse, or system manipulation is detected.
    </p>

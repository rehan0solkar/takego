    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how TakeGo collects, stores, and processes information 
        when users interact with the platform. TakeGo is a token-based takeaway order 
        management system developed as part of a Software Engineering academic project.
        The system is created strictly for educational demonstration and evaluation purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of This Project</h2>
    <p>
        TakeGo is not a commercial application and is not connected to any real-world 
        food delivery or payment processing service. All transactions, tokens, and 
        order flows are simulated for academic demonstration only.
        No real financial transactions are processed within this system.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collected</h2>
    <p>The platform may collect and store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username provided during registration</li>
        <li>User role (Customer or Stall Owner)</li>
        <li>Hashed password for authentication (not stored in plain text)</li>
        <li>Product and stall information added by Stall Owners</li>
        <li>Order details (product ID, quantity, price calculation)</li>
        <li>System-generated token numbers</li>
        <li>Order timestamps (creation time, acceptance time)</li>
        <li>Order status updates (pending, accepted, ready, cancelled, rejected)</li>
        <li>Logical deletion flags for soft-deleted orders</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To enable secure user authentication</li>
        <li>To support role-based access control (Customer / Owner)</li>
        <li>To simulate token-based takeaway order generation</li>
        <li>To allow stall owners to manage product inventory and orders</li>
        <li>To demonstrate database relationships (orders, order_items, products)</li>
        <li>To calculate estimated preparation time</li>
        <li>To evaluate system functionality during academic assessment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Authentication and Security</h2>
    <p>
        Passwords are stored using hashing mechanisms to demonstrate secure 
        development practices. The system uses role-based validation to restrict 
        access to customer and owner dashboards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although security best practices are demonstrated, this project is not 
        intended for production use and should not be used to store real sensitive information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Order and Token System</h2>
    <p>
        Tokens are automatically generated by the system using incremental logic 
        per stall. Token numbers are used to simulate queue management in a takeaway environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Orders move through different statuses such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pending</li>
        <li>Accepted</li>
        <li>Ready</li>
        <li>Cancelled</li>
        <li>Rejected</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Stall owners can update order status through the Owner Panel.
        Customers can track their order status from the order history section.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Soft Deletion of Orders</h2>
    <p>
        The system uses logical deletion (soft delete) for orders. 
        Instead of permanently removing records from the database, 
        an "is_deleted" flag may be applied for demonstration purposes.
        This helps illustrate database integrity and historical record retention.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data is stored in a SQLite database used strictly for development 
        and academic demonstration. The database may run locally or on a development server.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system does not collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Credit card information</li>
        <li>Banking details</li>
        <li>Government identification numbers</li>
        <li>Personal contact information beyond username</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        TakeGo does not sell, distribute, or share user data with third parties.
        All information remains within the academic project environment.
    </p>

    <h2>9. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        Since this is an academic project, users are advised not to register 
        using real sensitive or confidential data.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated if the academic project requirements change.
        Updates will be reflected with a revised “Last Updated” date.
    </p>

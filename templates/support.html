    <p>
        Welcome to the official Help & Support page of <strong>TakeGo</strong>.
        TakeGo is a token-based takeaway order management system developed as part of a Software Engineering academic project.
        This section provides complete guidance for Customers, Stall Owners, and academic evaluators regarding the platform’s usage and functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

    <h3>1. How do I register on TakeGo?</h3>
    <p>
        To use the system, you must first register yourself based on your role:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer:</strong> Register as a Customer to browse stalls and generate order tokens.</li>
        <li><strong>Stall Owner:</strong> Register as a Stall Owner to manage products and incoming orders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After registration, log in using your credentials to access your respective dashboard.
    </p>

    <h3>2. How do Customers place an order?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Register and log in as a Customer.</li>
        <li>Browse the list of available stalls.</li>
        <li>Select products from a stall.</li>
        <li>Choose the quantity (subject to availability).</li>
        <li>Click on “Generate Token” to confirm the order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Upon successful order placement, a unique token number is generated and displayed.
        The system also reduces product availability automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How does the Token System work?</h3>
    <p>
        Each confirmed order is assigned a sequential token number per stall.
        The token system simulates queue management within a takeaway environment.
        Tokens help demonstrate order tracking, preparation sequencing, and stall-level order management.
    </p>

    <h3>4. How is preparation time calculated?</h3>
    <p>
        The estimated preparation time is calculated dynamically based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The preparation time defined for each product.</li>
        <li>The quantity ordered.</li>
        <li>The queue logic implemented in the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This feature is implemented purely for academic demonstration of backend logic and database aggregation.
    </p>

    <h3>5. How can Customers track their orders?</h3>
    <p>
        Customers can access the <strong>"My Orders"</strong> section after logging in.
        This section displays:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Token number</li>
        <li>Order status (Pending, Accepted, Ready, Cancelled, Rejected)</li>
        <li>Total price</li>
        <li>Order items and quantities</li>
        <li>Estimated preparation time</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. How do Stall Owners manage orders?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Register and log in as a Stall Owner.</li>
        <li>Access the Owner Panel dashboard.</li>
        <li>Add, edit, or delete products.</li>
        <li>View incoming customer orders.</li>
        <li>Update order status to Accepted, Ready, Cancelled, or Rejected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Stall Owners can also manage product availability, which directly impacts token generation.
    </p>

    <h3>7. What happens if a product is deleted?</h3>
    <p>
        If a product is removed by a Stall Owner, previously generated orders remain visible in the system.
        Deleted products are displayed as “[Deleted Product]” in order history for data consistency and audit demonstration.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Does TakeGo support real payments?</h3>
    <p>
        No. TakeGo does not process real financial transactions.
        All pricing, order totals, and token generation features are simulated for academic evaluation purposes only.
